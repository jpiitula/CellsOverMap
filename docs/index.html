    <h1>Example</h1>

    <p>The <a href="numerot.html">example page</a> displays an
    artificial dataset where the names of nine digits in two languages
    are mapped on a plane by their approximate numerical value and the
    length of the word in letters. The page was then created with
    Cells over Map. (The command is in the Makefile.)</p>

    <p>If the browser interprets the page (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
      as intended, it shows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a small grid of cells populated with the number words
      <li>four sliders that reposition the grid on the underlying map
      <li>two slider that change the granularity of the grid
      <li>two empty info boxes below the grid
    </ul>

    <p>Click the words in the cells to fill the info boxes. Use the
    browser to increase the font size.</p>

    <p>The source data set is included in the page source. All source
      is in
      the <a href="https://github.com/jpiitula/CellsOverMap">Cells
      over Map repository</a>.</p>
