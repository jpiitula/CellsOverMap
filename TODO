The remaining troublespots of CelloMap

o [jpiitula] Allow external style and code
   Either in sibling files or at specified URL.

o [jpiitula] Match map region to data by default
   Allow options, warn if much data is outside specified range.

o [jpiitula] Label map coordinates more intuitively
   Vertical and horizontal, maybe, or at least show which is which and
   which way it grows.

o [jpiitula] Assign a license to the software
   Thinking of AGPL, but there was something about JavaScript
   specifically. Possible a Lesser AGPL would be good enough.

o [jpiitula] Implement sampling controls
   To reduce the amount of visible data. Should work by CSS. Most
   coordinate actions would simply reveal all points again,
   re-sampling would simply sample from all points again, and there
   would be two of these: sample all data, sample each cell (can it be
   some sort of radio control? at most one option selected?), with
   reasonable fixed probabilities, and that's it.
