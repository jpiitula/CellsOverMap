The remaining troublespots of CelloMap

o [jpiitula] Allow external style and code
   Either in sibling files or at specified URL.

o [jpiitula] Check map region limits
   Reject unless min before max, maybe warn if much data is outside
   specified range (allowing options so can happen).

o [jpiitula] Implement sampling controls
   To reduce the amount of visible data. Should work by CSS. Most
   coordinate actions would simply reveal all points again,
   re-sampling would simply sample from all points again, and there
   would be two of these: sample all data, sample each cell (can it be
   some sort of radio control? at most one option selected?), with
   reasonable fixed probabilities, and that's it.
