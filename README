Cells over Map (CelloMap) uses HTML5 (HTML) to present a planar
mapping of datapoints in rectangular cells laid over the map.

Input is the dataset as a single JSON array, in UTF-8, in which each
datapoint is an array containing four (4) items:

- a label, a string which CelloMap displays in the corresponding cell;

- two floating point literals, which CelloMap maps to a row and a
  column of the cell grid;

- a mapping of arbitrary key-strings to value-strings, which CelloMap
  can display for a selected point in a separate info box.

Output is a single HTML page that contains the dataset together with
styling and behaviour in CSS and JavaScript:

- the position of the grid of cells on the map can be adjusted, with
  points outside the grid always clamped in;

- the number of rows and columns (granularity) can be adjusted;

- metadata of two selected points at a time can be displayed.

The transformation of the dataset into the HTML page is carried out by
a Python script that basically checks some properties of the input,
computes the overall coordinates of the data, and fills a template.

CelloMap was originally written from scratch by Jussi Piitulainen
(jpiitula) in April 2017, out of general interest and for use in a
certain computational platform. It is made available as Free Software,
as defined by the Free Software Foundation, under a copyleft license.
((Details still missing.))

Two improvements are planned: simple random sampling of the data (in
the map or in the cells) to reduce clutter, and possibly highlighting
the labels of the points that are clamped in from outside the grid.
