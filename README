Cells-over-Map (CelloMap for shorter, CoM for truly short) is an HTML5
shower of a map of a planar dataset in cells.

A Python script wraps a JSON dataset in a self-contained HTML page
that shows the points in a table of cells over a rectangular region of
a map, allowing some simple interactive manipulations. Outside points
are clamped in.

Each data point consists of a UTF-8 label, two floating point
coordinates (mapped to rows and columns in CoM), and arbitrary
metadata as UTF-8 key:value pairs (with distinct keys).

    [
    ["one", 1.0, 3.14, { "size" : "1", "length" : "2" }],
    ["two", 2.1, 2.71, { "size" : "2" }]
    ]

The resulting page displays the labels of the points in cells in a
table and the metadata of two user-selected points in separate info
boxes. It also allows the user to adjust the location of the cells on
the underlying map.

CoM 0.1 was written from scratch over a weekend in April 2017 by Jussi
Piitulainen, inspired by a research-seminar representation where Seppo
Nyrkk√∂ showed a rudimentary HTML tabulation of a SOM (a
Self-Organizing Map).
